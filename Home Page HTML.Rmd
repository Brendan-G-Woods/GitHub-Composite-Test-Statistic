Welcome to the Composite Test Statistic Application. This page provides an intuitive and powerful alternative to traditional methods of defining and analysing composite outcomes.

## An Introduction to Composite Outcomes

Composite outcomes are a popular method to compare treatment effects across multiple outcomes simultaneously. They are particularly useful when the primary outcomes are rare, or to avoid the inflation of type I error that is associated with multiple testing if multiple outcome variables are of interest. 

However, some traditional definitions of composite outcomes have a major drawback – typically subjects are classed as either a “success” or a “failure” based on whether any one of the component outcomes occurs. This definition of a composite requires the dichotomisation of continuous outcomes into binary indicators of “success” or “fail”, based on a clinically chosen threshold. This offers a simple solution to defining a composite with diverse types of components, but it has a serious flaw. Large amounts of information can be lost through this dichotomisation and therefore lead to substantial losses in statistical power (the ability to detect if there is a treatment effect). 

## A Real-World Motivation: The EMERGE Trial

The Early Metformin in Gestational Diabetes trial (EMERGE) was a key motivator for developing the composite test statistic method. The trial defined a composite based on whether a participant:

 1. Required Insulin treatment
 
 2. Had a fasting glucose level $\ge$ 5.1 mmol/L at gestation week 32 (gw32)
 
 3. Had a fasting glucose level $\ge$  5.1 mmol/L at gestation week 38 (gw38)

Both gw32 and gw38 involve the dichotomisation of fasting glucose, a continuous measurement, before entering the composite. This dichotomisation resulted in a large loss of information, and ultimately led to an insignificant composite primary outcome, even though each of the individual components differed significantly between treatment groups.

This paradox, where we have significant individual outcomes but an insignificant composite outcome, highlights the issue of this traditional composite definition which can result in real treatment effects going undetected. This is due to the loss of information through the dichotomisation of continuous outcomes.

## How Composite Test Statistics Are Built Here

To address this paradox, we propose a new definition of a composite that is simple to do but avoids dichotomisation entirely. Instead of collapsing continuous data into binary events, we propose defining the composite as a combination of test statistics calculated for each outcome (e.g. t-values, z-scores). Because test statistics (such as t-scores or z-scores) are standardised, they place outcomes of different types (continuous, categorical, time-to-event) on a common scale. This makes them directly comparable and maintains the underlying data in its natural form.

The resulting composite test statistic can then be assessed using either:

 -	**Permutation Testing,** which provides an exact empirical null distribution.
 
 -	**Asymptotic simulations,** which approximates known distributions.
	
## Advantages of the Composite Test Statistic

In short, our composite test statistic improves power over traditional methods of forming composites comparing different data types and is readily useable for a diverse range of datasets. Compared with traditional methods of defining composite outcomes, this approach:

-	**Preserves information,** no dichotomisation is required, and continuous outcomes remain continuous

-	**Higher power** to detect significant treatment effects. Bootstrap power estimations that we performed comparing the composite test statistic method with the traditional definition used in EMERGE showed vast improvements, as demonstrated below.

```


-	**Applicable to mixed data sets,** we have expanded the concept of the composite test statistic to be able to handle categorical data and survival analyses.

-	**Transparent and Generalisable,** this method can be applied to a range of studies and is not limited to the world of clinical trials. Additionally, we have provided the source code for this application, which is available in the “Source Code” tab.
